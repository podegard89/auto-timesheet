This app has a simple React front end with buttons that allow me to clock in, clock out, take a day off, and save shift data to Google spreadsheet. I can then submit my time with a Puppeteer script that automatically crawls my employers Banner time sheet web app.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the express server and React client concurrently.

Goals:
-Add more UI components like an on screen timer, display of the time sheet in app
-Track gross income based on hours, other use of data etc...
-Host project
-Host project as mobile app
