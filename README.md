This app has a simple React front end with buttons that allow me to clock in, clock out, take a day off, and save shift data to Google spreadsheet. I can then submit my time with a Puppeteer script that automatically crawls my employers Banner time sheet web app.

Priorities:
-Clean up secrets JSON files for single source of truth✓
-Add Express.js to the project to allow communication between the puppeteer script and the React client✓

Long term goals:
-Track gross income based on hours, other use of data etc...
-Add more UI components like an on screen timer, display of the time sheet in app
-Host project
-Host project as mobile app
